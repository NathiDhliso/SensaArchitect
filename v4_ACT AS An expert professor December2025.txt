ACT AS: An expert professor and curriculum designer for the subject: [INSERT SUBJECT HERE].

OBJECTIVE: Create a "Visual Master Hierarchical Chart" (Structured Outline), "Concept Dependency Graph", "Decision Framework Trees", "Mental Anchor Set", "Mental Map Summary Diagram", and "Learning Path Sequence" for this subject. PRIORITY: Factual Accuracy, Strict Visual Structure, Positive Cognitive Framing, and Cognitive Load Optimization. You must expose the critical details, dependencies, and specific terminology using capability-focused language.

---

## STEP 1: LIVE VERIFICATION [Required for Accuracy]

Browse the web for the most recent official syllabus or standard (e.g., "Microsoft Learn Skills Measured," "2025 Tax Code," "Bar Exam Content Outline," authoritative textbook).

* **Scan for Updates:** Identify 3 specific topics added or emphasized in the last 12 months.
* **Extract Hard Data:** Look for specific numbers (statutory limits, dates, thresholds, version requirements, fee schedules) that have changed. If numerical data isn't publicly available, explicitly state this limitation.
* **Output:** State the source, the 3 updates, and any critical numerical limits found.

**FALLBACK:** If no recent official syllabus exists for this subject, state this explicitly and use the most authoritative textbook/standard as of January 2025. Proceed with Steps 2-7 using that source.

---

## STEP 2: DEFINE THE LIFECYCLE

Identify the 3-step operational cycle based on the subject type:

* **IT/Cloud:** PROVISION → CONFIGURE → MONITOR
* **Coding/Dev:** DEFINE → IMPLEMENT → DEBUG
* **Accountancy/Finance:** RECOGNIZE (Identify/Classify) → MEASURE (Calculate/Adjust) → DISCLOSE (Report/Audit)
* **Medicine/Nursing:** ASSESS/DIAGNOSE → TREAT/INTERVENE → MONITOR/EVALUATE
* **Law (Procedural):** PLEADING (File) → DISCOVERY (Fact Finding) → TRIAL (Adjudication)
* **Law (Transactional):** FORMATION (Offer/Accept) → PERFORMANCE (Execution) → REMEDY (Breach)
* **Science/Research:** HYPOTHESIZE (Question) → EXPERIMENT (Test) → ANALYZE (Conclude)
* **Project Management:** INITIATE (Charter) → EXECUTE (Deliver) → CLOSE (Review)
* **Education/Training:** INTRODUCE (Foundation) → PRACTICE (Application) → ASSESS (Evaluation)

**Instruction:** Choose the cycle that fits the subject best. If the subject doesn't match any standard pattern, derive a logical 3-phase cycle following the pattern: [Foundation Phase] → [Action Phase] → [Verification Phase], and justify your choice briefly before creating the chart. You must use these three exact verbs (or your custom three) as the sub-sections for every single Core Concept.

---

## STEP 2.5: CONCEPT DEPENDENCY GRAPH [Mental Map Foundation]

Create a visual dependency tree showing how concepts build upon each other. This helps students understand learning sequence and concept relationships.

**STRUCTURE:**
```
[FOUNDATION LAYER] - Concepts that enable everything else
  ↳ [DEPENDENT LAYER] - Concepts that extend foundation capabilities
     ↳ [INTEGRATION LAYER] - Concepts that connect multiple systems
```

**FORMATTING RULES:**
- Use clear hierarchical indentation with ↳ arrows
- Show parent-child relationships explicitly
- Include brief relationship labels in parentheses: (requires, contains, builds upon, connects to, enables)
- Maximum 3 layers deep to avoid cognitive overload
- Group related concepts under common parent nodes

**POSITIVE FRAMING IN RELATIONSHIPS:**
- ✅ Use: "enables", "extends", "builds upon", "integrates with"
- ✅ Use: "provides foundation for", "unlocks capability to"
- ❌ Avoid: "blocks", "prevents", "requires before you can", "cannot work without"

**DOMAIN-NEUTRAL EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:**

```
FOUNDATION LAYER (Core Capabilities - These Enable Everything Else)
├─ [Concept A] (The foundational capability)
│  ↳ [Concept B] (extends Concept A with additional features)
│     ↳ [Concept C] (integrates A + B for advanced scenarios)
│  ↳ [Concept D] (builds upon Concept A in parallel)
│     ↳ [Concept E] (connects capabilities from B and D)
└─ [Concept F] (Independent foundational capability)
   ↳ [Concept G] (extends Concept F functionality)
```

**QUALITY CRITERIA:**
- Every concept should appear exactly once in the tree
- Arrows should only point downward (showing capability expansion)
- If a concept extends multiple parents, show it under the PRIMARY parent and note secondary relationships
- Use domain-appropriate terminology (e.g., "Virtual Network hosts Subnets" for IT, "Complaint initiates Discovery" for Law, "Diagnosis guides Treatment Selection" for Medicine)

---

## STEP 3: GENERATE THE MASTER HIERARCHICAL CHART

Create a Single Code Block containing a structured outline. You must follow these STRICT FORMATTING & POSITIVE FRAMING RULES:

**VISUAL RULES:**
1. Use hierarchical bullet points with consistent indentation (2-4 spaces per level).
2. Use clear visual hierarchy: # for main sections, ## for Core Concepts, - for Phase 1, • for Phase 2, ○ for Phase 3.
3. Quality Standard: The format used for the first concept must be identical to the format used for the last concept. Maintain consistent detail level throughout.

**CONTENT DENSITY & POSITIVE FRAMING RULES:**

* **Foundation Level (Phase 1): The "Blueprint Pattern"**
   - Prerequisite: (What enables this? If nothing required, write "[None]")
   - Selection: (Which type/approach best serves the goal? Include specific capabilities/thresholds where known)
   - Execution: (The specific Tool/Form/Process/Document to begin)

* **Configuration Level (Phase 2): The "Capability Pattern"**
   • Use specific action verbs: "Enable", "Configure", "Define", "Establish", "Set", "Apply"
   • Mark important comparisons using **[Critical Distinction]:** followed by the two concepts and their key difference in capabilities
   • Include design boundaries and prerequisites using POSITIVE framing:
     - **[Design Boundary]:** Describes what the feature is designed for and when selection matters (replaces "Constraint")
     - **[Prerequisite Check]:** Identifies what must exist first, framed as planning guidance (replaces "Requirement")
     - **[Exam Focus]:** Highlights tested concepts (replaces "Exam Alert")

**POSITIVE FRAMING TRANSFORMATION GUIDE:**

| ❌ Negative Statement | ✅ Positive Reframe |
|---|---|
| "Cannot change after creation" | "[Design Boundary]: Selection made at creation time (plan ahead during provisioning)" |
| "Cannot be revoked individually" | "[Design Boundary]: Revocation managed through stored access policies or key rotation" |
| "Does not support X" | "[Design Boundary]: Optimized for Y and Z scenarios (use [Alternative] for X scenarios)" |
| "Requires minimum of X" | "[Prerequisite Check]: Best performance achieved with X or higher" |
| "Will fail if X" | "[Prerequisite Check]: Verify X is configured before proceeding" |
| "Cannot delete" | "[Design Boundary]: Protected by design (remove protection via [method] when needed)" |
| "Does not inherit" | "[Design Boundary]: Applied directly to each resource (use policy for automated assignment)" |

* **Verification Level (Phase 3): The "Evidence Pattern"**
   ○ Name the exact tool, document, metric, test, or procedure (e.g., "Westlaw Citator", "Blood Gas Analysis", "Azure Monitor Logs", "IRS Form 8879")
   ○ Do not invent tool/document names
   ○ Include specific metrics, deadlines, or thresholds to monitor where relevant
   ○ Frame as "what to observe" rather than "what to watch out for"

* **Verification Protocol:** If a specific design boundary, limit, statutory cite, or tool name is unknown, state **[Verify in Docs]** or **[Check Official Source]**. Do not fabricate data to fill the space.

**TARGET FORMAT EXAMPLE (Follow this structure exactly):**

```
[SUBJECT NAME]

CORE CONCEPT 1: [Name]
[PHASE 1 VERB] (The Foundation)
  - Prerequisite: [Specific Enabler OR "[None]"]
  - Selection: [Option A (capability: X)] vs. [Option B (capability: Y)]
  - Execution: [Tool/Form/Process/Document]

[PHASE 2 VERB] (The Configuration)
  • Configure Feature: [Specific Setting/Procedure Name]
  • [Critical Distinction]: [Term A] vs. [Term B - How They Differ in Capability]
  • [Design Boundary]: [What this is designed for, when selection matters]
  • [Prerequisite Check]: [What enables this feature to work optimally]

[PHASE 3 VERB] (The Verification)
  ○ Tool/Document: [Specific Name - e.g., "Form 1040 Schedule C", "Cardiac Stress Test", "NSG Flow Logs"]
  ○ Metric/Deadline: [Specific Threshold/Target to Observe]

CORE CONCEPT 2: [Name]
[PHASE 1 VERB] (The Foundation)
  - Prerequisite: [Specific Enabler OR "[None]"]
  - Selection: [Option A] vs. [Option B]
  - Execution: [Tool/Form/Process/Document]

[PHASE 2 VERB] (The Configuration)
  • Enable Feature: [Specific Name]
  • [Prerequisite Check]: [What must be in place for optimal operation]

[PHASE 3 VERB] (The Verification)
  ○ Tool/Document: [Specific Name]
  ○ Metric/Deadline: [Specific Target]

[Continue for all Core Concepts...]
```

**QUALITY VERIFICATION:**
Before finalizing, verify:
✓ Every Core Concept has identical depth (Foundation, Configuration, Verification structure)
✓ No concept uses generic placeholders like "various settings", "file paperwork", or "review documents"
✓ All numerical limits, statutory cites, or specifications are sourced or marked [Verify in Docs]
✓ Formatting characters (-, •, ○) are consistent throughout
✓ The first and last Core Concepts have the same level of detail
✓ All phase labels consistently use "(The Foundation)", "(The Configuration)", "(The Verification)"
✓ Domain-appropriate terminology is used (e.g., "File Motion" for law, "Enable Feature" for tech, "Administer Drug" for medicine)
✓ NO negative framing: no "cannot", "fails", "prevents", "blocks", "dangerous" language
✓ ALL boundaries framed as "designed for" or "optimized for" with alternatives mentioned

---

## STEP 3.5: DECISION FRAMEWORK TREES [Choice Architecture]

Create 2-3 decision trees for the most common "When do I use X vs Y?" questions in this domain. Frame entirely around selection criteria and capabilities unlocked.

**STRUCTURE FOR EACH TREE:**

```
**Decision: [Student Question Phrased as Capability Choice]**
├─ When [Scenario A] → Choose [Option 1]
│  └─ Unlocks: [Specific capability/benefit]
│  └─ Best for: [Concrete use case]
├─ When [Scenario B] → Choose [Option 2]
│  └─ Unlocks: [Specific capability/benefit]
│  └─ Best for: [Concrete use case]
└─ When [Scenario C] → Choose [Option 3]
   └─ Unlocks: [Specific capability/benefit]
   └─ Best for: [Concrete use case]
```

**POSITIVE FRAMING RULES:**
- ✅ Use: "Choose X when you need [benefit]"
- ✅ Use: "Option Y unlocks [capability]"
- ✅ Use: "Select Z for [specific scenario]"
- ✅ Use: "Best suited for", "Optimized for", "Designed for"
- ❌ Avoid: "Don't use X if...", "X fails when...", "Won't work for..."
- ❌ Avoid: "Common mistake is...", "Students wrongly...", "Avoid X because..."

**DOMAIN-NEUTRAL EXAMPLE TEMPLATES:**

**IT/Cloud Domain:**
```
**Decision: Which connectivity approach best serves my scenario?**
├─ When both systems are in the same region and need low latency
│  └─ Choose: Direct Connection Method
│  └─ Unlocks: Minimal network hops, Azure backbone routing
│  └─ Best for: Two application tiers in the same datacenter
├─ When systems span regions and need encrypted transport
│  └─ Choose: Encrypted Tunnel Method
│  └─ Unlocks: Cross-region security, compliance-ready traffic
│  └─ Best for: US and EU deployments sharing customer data
└─ When connecting to external or on-premises systems
   └─ Choose: Gateway Method
   └─ Unlocks: Controlled entry point, centralized logging
   └─ Best for: Cloud application accessing corporate database
```

**Law Domain:**
```
**Decision: Which legal framework best applies to this situation?**
├─ When parties established a written agreement with explicit terms
│  └─ Choose: Contract Law Analysis
│  └─ Unlocks: Enforcement based on express terms
│  └─ Best for: Signed lease specifying rent amount and duration
├─ When one party relied on another's promise absent formal contract
│  └─ Choose: Promissory Estoppel Analysis
│  └─ Unlocks: Enforcement via detrimental reliance doctrine
│  └─ Best for: Employee relocated based on oral job offer
└─ When the situation involves wrongful conduct causing harm
   └─ Choose: Tort Law Analysis
   └─ Unlocks: Remedy framework via duty, breach, causation, damages
   └─ Best for: Negligent driving causing injury
```

**Medicine Domain:**
```
**Decision: Which imaging modality best serves the diagnostic need?**
├─ When evaluating bone structures or dense tissue
│  └─ Choose: X-Ray (Radiography)
│  └─ Unlocks: Fast acquisition, excellent bone visualization
│  └─ Best for: Suspected wrist fracture after fall
├─ When assessing soft tissue, organs, or vascular structures
│  └─ Choose: MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
│  └─ Unlocks: Superior soft tissue contrast, no radiation exposure
│  └─ Best for: Suspected ACL tear in knee
└─ When time-critical assessment is needed
   └─ Choose: CT Scan (Computed Tomography)
   └─ Unlocks: Rapid acquisition, excellent for acute pathology
   └─ Best for: Head trauma to rule out intracranial bleed
```

**SELECTION GUIDELINES:**
Choose decisions that involve:
- Frequently compared similar options (different tools serving overlapping purposes)
- Context-dependent choices (same goal, different approaches based on environment)
- Trade-off scenarios (speed vs. cost, simplicity vs. flexibility, security vs. accessibility)

## STEP 4: VISUAL MENTAL ANCHORS [CRITICAL FOR LEARNING]

Create 3 specific "Visual Mental Models" that illuminate the hardest conceptual relationships in this subject. Each anchor must follow this exact structure with STRICT POSITIVE FRAMING.

**MANDATORY COMPONENTS FOR EACH ANCHOR:**

1. **Title Format:** 
   `**Anchor [Number]: [Descriptive Name That Captures The Core Concept]**`

2. **Visualization Section:**
   • Begin with: "Picture...", "Imagine...", or "Visualize..."
   • Use a CONCRETE, PHYSICAL metaphor from everyday life (buildings, vehicles, tools, nature, sports, cooking, family structures, games, etc.)
   • Map AT LEAST 3-4 specific technical/legal/medical concepts to physical elements in your metaphor
   • Include spatial relationships (above/below, inside/outside, connected/separate, before/after)
   • Make it vivid enough that a student can close their eyes and SEE it
   • Avoid domain-specific jargon in the metaphor itself (the metaphor should be universally understandable)

3. **Why It Helps Section - POSITIVE FRAMING MANDATORY:**
   • Start with capability-focused phrases:
     - ✅ "Clarifies the relationship between..."
     - ✅ "Shows how X enables Y..."
     - ✅ "Illustrates the connection between..."
     - ✅ "Makes visible how X flows into Y..."
     - ✅ "Reveals why X comes before Y..."
     - ✅ "Demonstrates how these concepts work together..."
   
   • **STRICT PROHIBITION - Never use these phrases:**
     - ❌ "Prevents the mistake of..."
     - ❌ "Students wrongly assume..."
     - ❌ "This stops confusion about..."
     - ❌ "Common error is..."
     - ❌ "Avoids the problem of..."
     - ❌ "Prevents exam errors where..."
     - ❌ "Students don't realize..."
     - ❌ "Most people incorrectly think..."
   
   • Instead, reframe as capability understanding:
     - "This makes visible the connection between X and Y, enabling students to see how..."
     - "Students can now understand how A leads to B because..."
     - "This reveals the relationship between X and Y, showing that..."
     - "The metaphor illuminates how X and Y interact, demonstrating that..."

   • Connect the metaphor back to technical/legal/medical reality using domain-appropriate terms

**QUALITY CRITERIA FOR ANCHORS:**

**Domain-Neutral Examples:**

- ❌ **BAD:** "Authentication is like a key" (too vague, single mapping, tech-only framing)
- ✅ **GOOD:** "Picture a three-layer security gate system at a building entrance: Layer 1 is the front door badge reader verifying WHO you are (authentication), Layer 2 is the elevator access card determining WHICH FLOORS you can visit (authorization), Layer 3 is the building rules posted everywhere defining WHAT ACTIONS are allowed regardless of role (governance policies)"

- ❌ **BAD:** "Contract formation is just making an agreement" (abstract, no visual)
- ✅ **GOOD:** "Picture two people completing a handshake in three distinct motions: Person A extends their hand outward (the Offer - a definite proposal with specific terms), Person B grasps and shakes it (the Acceptance - unequivocal agreement to those exact terms), and a third person watching nods to confirm both hands met properly (Consideration - something of value exchanged). If Person B adjusts their grip or extends different fingers, this starts a new handshake sequence (counteroffer creating a new offer)."

**EXAMPLE OF COMPLETE ANCHOR WITH POSITIVE FRAMING:**

**Anchor 1: The Three-Story Security Building**

**Visualization:** Picture a modern three-story office building with a sophisticated security system. The Ground Floor Lobby (Microsoft Entra ID - Identity Layer) is where everyone receives their employee badge—this establishes WHO you are (user account, group membership, MFA enrollment). The elevator system with badge readers on each floor (RBAC - Authorization Layer) determines WHICH FLOORS you can access based on your role—an intern's badge opens the first floor (Reader role), a senior engineer's badge opens floors 1-2 (Contributor role), and the CTO's badge opens all three floors plus the executive suite (Owner role). The badge reader checks your scope: building-wide access (Management Group scope), floor access (Subscription scope), specific wing access (Resource Group scope), or individual room access (Resource scope). Throughout the building, digital signs display the building's operational rules (Azure Policy - Governance Layer)—these define WHAT ACTIONS are allowed: "All workstations must have encryption enabled," "Fire exits must remain unblocked," "Sensitive documents must be locked at end of day." Security cameras (compliance scans) verify adherence to these rules across all floors.

**Why It Helps:** This clarifies the three-layered relationship between authentication, authorization, and governance in Azure security architecture. The building metaphor makes visible how identity (ground floor badge) enables authorization (elevator access), and how governance policies (building rules) operate independently across all roles. Students can now see that RBAC scope follows a hierarchical inheritance pattern—permissions granted at the building level (Management Group) flow downward through floors (Subscriptions) to wings (Resource Groups) and individual rooms (Resources). The metaphor illustrates how policies evaluate at resource creation time regardless of role assignment, demonstrating that governance operates as a parallel control plane. This reveals why Owner role assignment at the subscription level automatically grants access to all resource groups beneath it, and shows how policy enforcement remains consistent across all identity types.

---

## STEP 5: WORKED EXAMPLE [DEMONSTRATES PRACTICAL APPLICATION]

Provide ONE fully-worked scenario showing how the chart solves a realistic problem. Use domain-appropriate language and maintain positive framing throughout.

**Required Structure:**
1. **Student Question:** A specific, realistic troubleshooting scenario, case analysis, or "why doesn't X work?" question appropriate to the domain
2. **Chart Navigation:** Step-by-step walkthrough of which Core Concepts and nodes to consult
3. **The Diagnosis:** What the chart reveals about the situation (framed as understanding gaps, not "what's wrong")
4. **The Solution:** Concrete action items derived from the chart (framed as "what to enable/configure")
5. **Learning Point:** Why the three-phase structure (Foundation → Configuration → Verification) helped solve it

**POSITIVE FRAMING IN WORKED EXAMPLE:**
- ✅ Frame as: "The chart reveals that X needs Y to function optimally"
- ✅ Frame as: "Understanding the Foundation phase shows that..."
- ✅ Frame as: "The Configuration section indicates that Z should be enabled"
- ❌ Avoid: "The problem is...", "This is misconfigured", "You forgot to..."

**DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXAMPLE QUALITY STANDARDS:**

**TECHNOLOGY EXAMPLE:**
```
Student Question: "I deployed an Azure VM and can ping the public IP successfully, but RDP connections time out. What should I check?"

Chart Navigation:
→ CORE CONCEPT 11: Virtual Machines (CONFIGURATION section)
→ Check: Network Interface + NSG association documented
→ CORE CONCEPT 20: Network Security Groups (CONFIGURATION section)
→ Check: Inbound Security Rules, rule priority evaluation order
→ Use VERIFICATION tools: Effective Security Rules blade, IP Flow Verify

The Diagnosis: The chart reveals that successful ICMP traffic (ping) confirms the network path is functional at the IP layer. The Configuration section shows that RDP operates on TCP port 3389, which requires an explicit NSG rule. The Effective Security Rules tool can display the merged ruleset from both subnet and NIC-level NSGs.

The Solution: 
1. Navigate to VM's Network Interface → Effective Security Rules to view current ruleset
2. Use IP Flow Verify to test: Source=[Your IP], Destination=[VM IP], Port=3389, Protocol=TCP
3. If IP Flow Verify shows "Denied", add inbound rule to NSG: Priority 1000, Source: [Your IP/32], Destination: Any, Port: 3389, Protocol: TCP, Action: Allow
4. Verify with IP Flow Verify showing "Access allowed"

Learning Point: The PROVISION → CONFIGURE → MONITOR structure guided systematic exploration: the VM exists with proper networking foundation (Foundation phase complete), but the security configuration needed an additional rule for RDP traffic (Configuration phase refinement), and diagnostic tools in the Verification phase confirmed the specific port behavior before and after the change. This approach shows how the three-phase pattern helps identify which layer needs attention without guessing.
```

## STEP 6: MENTAL MAP SUMMARY DIAGRAM [Big Picture Visualization]

Create a one-page text-based diagram showing all concepts as connected nodes with relationship arrows. This gives students the "bird's eye view" of the entire domain.

**STRUCTURE:**

```

                              └──(extends)──> [🟢 Concept G]
```

**FORMATTING RULES:**
- Use ASCII art with clear arrows and consistent spacing
- Maximum 10-15 nodes to avoid visual overload
- Group related concepts spatially (security concepts together, networking concepts together, etc.)
- Show only PRIMARY relationships (not every possible connection)
- Use color markers (🔴🟡🟢) or labels for priority tiers
- Keep horizontal width under 80 characters for readability
- Use positive relationship verbs: "enables", "extends", "connects", "observes" (not "requires", "depends on", "must have")

**DOMAIN-NEUTRAL EXAMPLE:**

```

```

**QUALITY CRITERIA:**
- Every Core Concept from Step 3 appears exactly once
- Arrows flow logically (foundation → dependent → integration)
- Relationship labels describe capabilities unlocked
- The diagram can be "read" left-to-right or top-to-bottom naturally
- Students can trace a path from any starting node to related concepts

- Stage 2 Milestone: "Order targeted diagnostics and interpret results within clinical context"
- Stage 3 Milestone: "Manage complex cases with multiple comorbidities and treatment interactions"

**QUALITY CRITERIA:**
- 3-4 stages maximum (more creates overwhelming roadmap)
- Each stage has 3-5 concepts (not too sparse, not too dense)
- Clear progression: each stage explicitly references capabilities from previous stages
- Hands-on practice suggestions are specific, not generic ("Practice networking" ❌ vs. "Deploy two VMs in separate subnets and configure peering" ✅)
- Milestones describe measurable capabilities, not vague goals
